Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin, pemetrexed, carboplatin, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving pembrolizumab with usual chemotherapy may help increase survival times in patients with stage IIA, IIB, IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To compare the disease free survival (DFS) between Arm B versus (vs) Arm C in patients with stage IIA-IIIB (T3-4N2) non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare the overall survival (OS) between the two treatment arms in patients with stage IIA-IIIB (T3-4N2) non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nII. To compare the adverse event rates and drug discontinuation rates due to adverse events in patients with stage IIA-IIIB (T3-4N2) non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nIII. To compare the adverse event (AE) rates for Arms B and C with A (prior to Update #7) and estimate the DFS and OS in Arm A.\n\nIV. To compare the DFS and OS in patients with stage IIA-IIIB (T3-4N2) non-small cell lung cancer that receive at least 2 cycles of initial adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\nQUALITY OF LIFE OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare patient-reported quality of life (QOL) one year after randomization as assessed by the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ)-Core (C)30 between patients randomized to receive adjuvant chemotherapy followed by pembrolizumab (Arm B), and those randomized to receive adjuvant chemotherapy + pembrolizumab concomitantly (Arm C).\n\nII. To compare patient-reported QOL at completion of chemotherapy as assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30 between patients randomized to receive adjuvant chemotherapy followed by pembrolizumab (Arm B) and those randomized to receive adjuvant chemotherapy + pembrolizumab concomitantly (Arm C).\n\nIII.
